# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 13/09/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how **Ig‑Creator** (the “App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our services. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in a transparent, secure, and lawful manner.

> **Important:** Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the **Google API Services User Data Policy**, including the **Limited Use** requirements.

## Who we are

* **App name:** Ig‑Creator
* **Contact email:** \[[zakuk0939@gmail.com](mailto:zakuk0939@gmail.com)]

---

## What data we collect

We aim to collect the minimum data necessary to provide the App’s functionality.

### 1) Google account & OAuth data

* Google account identifier and basic profile information (e.g., email address) provided through OAuth consent.
* OAuth tokens required to access Gmail with your permission (access token, refresh token).

### 2) Gmail data (read‑only)

* **Scope requested:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`.
* Depending on your in‑app use, we may access:

  * Message metadata (e.g., message ID, sender, subject, timestamps)
  * Message content and headers (read‑only) if you explicitly request operations that display message body text
  * Labels and thread metadata
* **We do not send emails, delete emails, or modify your mailbox** with this scope.

### 3) Diagnostic & device information (optional)

* Basic technical logs and error reports to maintain reliability (e.g., timestamps, request failures, performance metrics). These logs do **not** intentionally include Gmail content.

We **do not** knowingly collect sensitive categories of personal information beyond what is necessary to provide the features you use.

---

## How we use your data

We use your data to:

* Authenticate your account and maintain your session via OAuth
* Retrieve and display Gmail data you request (e.g., listing unread messages)
* Provide core features of the App
* Diagnose, prevent, and fix errors and abuse

We do **not** use Gmail data for advertising or marketing.

---

## Limited Use & Google policy compliance

* We only use Google user data to provide or improve user‑facing features that are prominent in the App’s interface.
* We do not transfer Google user data to third parties except as necessary to provide or improve the App’s user‑facing features (and only with appropriate protections), to comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger/acquisition with continued adherence to this Policy.
* We do not use Google user data for serving ads, profiling, or building independent datasets.

---

## Data storage & retention

We follow a **data minimization** approach:

* **Gmail content:** By default, Gmail message content and metadata are processed **ephemerally** to render the requested view and are **not stored** on our servers. If a feature requires temporary caching, it is kept only as long as necessary to perform that feature.
* **OAuth tokens:** Stored securely (encrypted at rest) to maintain access you have granted. Tokens are revoked when you disconnect the App or after prolonged inactivity, as applicable.
* **Diagnostics:** Non‑content logs retained for up to \[90] days unless a longer period is required to investigate abuse or comply with law.

If you configure the App to persist data (e.g., saving message summaries), we will clearly disclose this in‑app and allow you to delete persisted data.

---

## Data sharing

We do **not** sell your personal information. We only share data:

* With service providers (sub‑processors) who help us operate the App (e.g., cloud hosting, error monitoring). They are bound by confidentiality and security obligations and may only use the data as instructed by us.
* To comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or enforceable governmental requests.
* To protect the safety, rights, or property of our users, the public, or the App.
* In a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, where the successor is bound by this Policy or an equivalent policy.

A current list of material sub‑processors is available upon request.

## Your choices & controls

You can:

* **Revoke access** at any time in your Google Account → *Security* → *Third‑party access* (remove Ig‑Creator). This immediately prevents further API access by the App.
* **Delete local data** stored by the App (e.g., local cache/tokens) via in‑app settings or by following our support instructions.
* **Request deletion** of any server‑stored personal data by contacting us at \[[support@yourdomain.com](mailto:support@yourdomain.com)].

---

## Security

We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information, including:

* Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and encryption at rest for stored tokens
* Access controls, least‑privilege permissions, and audit logging
* Vulnerability management and regular review of access tokens and keys

No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we work continuously to improve our security posture.

---

## International data transfers

If we process data outside your country, we rely on appropriate legal mechanisms (e.g., standard contractual clauses, equivalent frameworks) where required by law.

---

## Children’s privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## Legal bases (EEA/UK only)

Where GDPR applies, we process data under one or more of the following legal bases:

* **Consent:** when you grant OAuth permission and use features that access Gmail data
* **Legitimate interests:** to secure and improve the App
* **Legal obligation:** when processing is necessary to comply with applicable law

You have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or object to processing, and to data portability. Contact us to exercise these rights.

---

## Data retention & deletion

We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, then delete or anonymize it. You may request deletion at any time. If you revoke Google access, we will promptly delete associated tokens and cease accessing your Gmail data.

---

## Changes to this policy

We may update this Policy to reflect changes to our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. We will post the updated Policy with a new “Last updated” date, and where required, we will notify you and/or seek your consent.
