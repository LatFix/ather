**Last updated:** 13/09/2025

Welcome to **Ig‑Creator** (the “App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the App and any related websites, services, and content that we provide (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

> If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and capable of forming a binding contract to use the Services. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

---

## 3. Your account & authorization

To use certain features, you may connect your Google account and grant OAuth permissions. You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials and for any activities that occur under your account. You may revoke the App’s access at any time via your Google Account security settings.

---

## 4. Permitted use & Acceptable use

You may use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:

* Access, extract, store, or process data from Google services except as permitted by the OAuth scopes you granted and in compliance with Google’s policies.
* Use the Services to violate any law, infringe intellectual property or privacy rights, or engage in abusive, harmful, or fraudulent behavior.
* Interfere with or disrupt the Services or circumvent security or access controls.
* Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive source code from the Services, except to the extent allowed by applicable law.

We may suspend or terminate your access for violations of this section.

## 5. Third‑party services (Google APIs)

The Services may rely on third‑party services, including Google APIs. Your use of such services is subject to their terms and policies, including the **Google API Services User Data Policy** (and Limited Use requirements). We do not control and are not responsible for third‑party services.

---

## 6. Privacy

Please review our **Privacy Policy**, which explains how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using the Services, you acknowledge that we will process your information as described in the Privacy Policy.

---

## 7. Data handling & Gmail read‑only scope

The App requests the Gmail read‑only scope (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`) to display email metadata and, when you request it, message content. We do not send, delete, or modify your emails. We follow a data‑minimization approach and do not store Gmail content on our servers unless a feature explicitly requires it, in which case we will disclose that use within the App.

---

## 8. Subscription, fees & taxes (if applicable)

If we offer paid features, pricing and billing terms will be presented within the App or on our website. Fees are non‑refundable except where required by law or as expressly stated. You are responsible for all applicable taxes.

---

## 9. Intellectual property

We own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services and related content, subject to user content and third‑party materials. We grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to use the Services for your internal purposes in accordance with these Terms. All trademarks, logos, and service marks are our property or the property of their respective owners.

---

## 10. Feedback

If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us a non‑exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty‑free license to use and exploit that feedback without restriction or compensation.

---

## 11. Service availability & changes

We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (or any part) at any time, with or without notice. We will not be liable for any unavailability or modifications.

---

## 12. Warranties & disclaimers

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR‑FREE, SECURE, OR FREE FROM HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

---

## 13. Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL; ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US (IF ANY) FOR THE SERVICES IN THE 3 MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, OR (B) USD \$100.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in such cases, the above limitations shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.

---

## 14. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless \[Your Legal Entity Name] and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or related to: (a) your use of the Services; (b) your violation of these Terms; or (c) your violation of any laws or third‑party rights.

---

## 15. Term & termination

These Terms remain in effect while you use the Services. We may suspend or terminate your access at any time for any reason, including if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ceases immediately. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnity) will survive termination.

---

## 16. Governing law & dispute resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of \[Your Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict‑of‑law principles. Any disputes will be resolved exclusively in the courts located in \[Venue / City, Country], and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.

**Optional arbitration clause:** If you prefer arbitration, replace the above with:

> Any dispute will be finally resolved by binding arbitration under the rules of \[arbitration body], with a single arbitrator, in \[City, Country], in English. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. Class actions and jury trials are waived to the fullest extent permitted by law.

---

## 17. Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (e.g., by posting in‑app or on our website) and update the “Last updated” date. Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

---

## 18. Export controls

You must comply with applicable export control and sanctions laws and may not use or access the Services if you are located in or are a resident of a jurisdiction subject to comprehensive sanctions or are otherwise on a restricted list.

---

## 19. Miscellaneous

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services and supersede prior agreements. If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right is not a waiver. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent; we may assign them in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
