      <h1>Terms of Service — Ig‑Creator</h1>
      <p class="sub">Last updated: September 13, 2025</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access to and use of Ig‑Creator and any related websites, services, and content (the "Services"). By using the Services, you agree to these Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1) Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be of legal age in your jurisdiction and capable of forming a binding contract to use the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.</p>

    <h2>2) Your account & OAuth authorization</h2>
    <p>Certain features require connecting your Google account and granting OAuth permissions. You are responsible for your login credentials and any activity under your account. You may revoke Ig‑Creator's access at any time in your Google Account security settings.</p>

    <h2>3) Permitted use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to access data beyond the OAuth scopes you approved.</li>
      <li>Do not interfere with or disrupt the Services or bypass security controls.</li>
      <li>Do not use the Services to violate intellectual property, privacy, or other rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Third‑party services</h2>
    <p>The Services rely on third‑party services, including Google APIs. Your use of those services is subject to their terms and policies, including the Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use). We are not responsible for third‑party services.</p>

    <h2>5) Privacy</h2>
    <p>Please review our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on how we collect, use, and protect information.</p>

    <h2>6) Data handling & scope</h2>
    <p>The App requests the Gmail read‑only scope (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly</code>) to display email metadata and, when you request it, message content. The Services do not send, delete, or modify your emails.</p>

    <h2>7) Fees</h2>
    <p>If any paid features are offered, pricing and terms will be disclosed within the Services. Fees are non‑refundable except where required by law.</p>

    <h2>8) Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>We own the Services and related content, excluding user content and third‑party materials. We grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to use the Services in accordance with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>9) Feedback</h2>
    <p>If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us a non‑exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty‑free license to use that feedback without restriction or compensation.</p>

    <h2>10) Availability & changes</h2>
    <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or part) at any time without liability.</p>

    <h2>11) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR‑FREE.</p>

    <h2>12) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED USD $100 OR THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SERVICES IN THE THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM.</p>

    <h2>13) Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Ig‑Creator and its personnel from claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Services or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>14) Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time, with or without notice, including for violations of these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ceases immediately. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, limitations, indemnity) will survive.</p>

    <h2>15) Governing terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services and supersede prior agreements. If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any right is not a waiver.</p>

    <h2>16) Dispute resolution</h2>
    <p>Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or the Services will be handled in accordance with applicable laws and brought in a competent court. You and we will first attempt to resolve disputes informally where feasible.</p>

    <h2>17) Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice (e.g., in‑app or on our website) and update the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.</p>
